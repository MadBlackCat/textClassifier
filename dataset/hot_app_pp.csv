Some you can only end on good notes if you pay for the choices, and in HIS it's all kinds of stupid how the endings are played out. As well, Bad boy blues you can only keep your man if you pay for the choice. New book Zombies...so funny until it started costing diamonds & I stopped reading it. Another book does that too so I just won't read it either. Not cool. Also, suddenly all the new updates are not compatible with my iPad?? Now I am missing out on some of the extra benefits.
