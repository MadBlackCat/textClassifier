[@Uber uses rider's device location services to make it easier to get a safe, reliable ride whenever you need one. Location data helps improve our services, including pickups, navigation, and customer support.#User Control*]
[@You may enable/disable, or adjust, Uber's collection of rider location information at any time through the Privacy Settings menu in the Uber app, or via the settings on your mobile device. If you disable the device location services on your device, your use of the Uber app will be affected. For example, you will need to manually enter your pickup or dropoff locations. In addition, location information will be collected from the driver during your trip and linked to your account, even if you have not enabled Uber to collect your location information.#User Control*]
[@Share Live Location (Riders)#User Control*]
[@If you have enabled the device location services on your mobile device, you may also enable Uber to share your location with your driver from the time you request a ride to the start of your trip. This makes it easier for your driver to pick you up.#User Control*]
[@You may enable/disable location sharing with your driver at any time through the Privacy Settings menu in the Uber app. You may use the Uber app if you have not enabled location sharing, but it may be more difficult for your driver to locate you.#User Control*]

B. DEVICE PERMISSIONS
[@Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The iOS platform will alert you the first time the Uber app wants permission to access certain types of data and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the permissions that the Uber app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your consent.#User Control*]
C. RATINGS LOOK-UP
[@After every trip, drivers and riders are able to rate each other, as well as give feedback on how the trip went. This two-way system holds everyone accountable for their behavior. Accountability helps create a respectful, safe environment for both drivers and riders#User Control*].
